# Virtual Reality Icons (2017.4.8)

This icon set is intended for describing VR systems, made available under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License. 

The icon set is divided into the following categories:

### External Communication
How the VR headset communicates data, if any.

 * `Wireless:` The headset communicates wirelessly with an external device (fx a computer).
 * `Cabled:` The headset communicates with an external device using a cabled connection.
 * `All Included:` The headset has no external communication which implies that all processing is done internally.
 * `Phone-based:` The headset relies on a phone to provide display and processing.

### Screen Resolution
The screen resolution across the headset display.

 * `SD:` The headset provides a resolution of 854x480.
 * `HD:` The headset provides a resolution of 1920x1080.
 * `4K:` The headset provides a resolution of 3840x2160.

### Audio
The headset's audio capabilities.

 * `No Audio:` The headset provides no audio output or input itself.
 * `Headphones built-in:` The headset provides audio output through built-in headphones.
 * `Headphones w/ mic:` The headset has built-in headphones and a microphone.

### See Through
Whether the headset can provide image of the outside world when worn.

 * `No See through:` The headset has no ability to show the outside world while worn.
 * `Videofeed See Through:` The headset provides a videofeed through a single front-facing camera (no parallax effect).
 * `Videofeed Stereo See Through:`The headset provides a videofeed in stereo through two front-facing cameras.
  `Optical See Through:` The headset provides a transparent display which allows the user to see through directly.

### Field of View
How wide a field of view the VR headset provides.

 * `Wide Field of View:` The user can see widely.
 * `Narrow Field of View:` The user can see narrowly (a very narrow view could fx be feel like wearing horse blinds).

### Head Tracking
The headset's ability to track motion of the user's head and facial features.

 * `Positional Tracking:` The headset tracks head panning (movement of the head forwards, backwards, left and right).
 * `Rotational Tracking:` The headset tracks head rotation (the head tilting forward, backward, right and left).
 * `Eye Tracking:` The headset is capable of tracking eye movement and dilation while worn.
 
### VR Hand Controller(s)
How the user's ability to control the VR system using one or both hands.

 * `Button-based hand control:` The user controls the VR system using input from fx a gamepad or joystick.
 * `Wand-based control:` The user controls the VR system using a wand which is tracked by its position and rotation (6 Degrees of Freedom).
 * `Wand-based control (Rotational only):` The user controls the VR system using a wand which is tracked by its rotation (3 Degrees of Freedom).
 * `Free-hand control:` The user controls the VR system using free movement of their hands.
 * `Free-hand and Finger control:` The user controls the VR system using free movement of their hands and fingers.
 * `One-handed control:` The user controls the VR system by wielding a controller in one hand.
 * `Two-handed control:` The user controls the VR system by wielding a controller in both hands.

### VR Environment Tracking
How signals are sent between the sensors and controllers (if any), to track the user's actions.

 * `Emitting Sensor Tower:` User actions are tracked through sensors in the environment emitting signals to track passive controllers.
 * `Emitting Controller:` User actions are tracked through controllers which emit signals to passive sensors.
 * `Emitting VR Headset:` User actions are tracked through sensors on the VR headset emitting signals to track passive controllers.

### VR Environment Setup
How many sensor towers in the real world are set up to track user actions.

 * `Three Tower Setup:` The user is positioned amid three sensors in the environment.
 * `Two Tower Setup:` The user is positioned amid two sensors in the environment.
 * `Two Tower Setup:` The user is positioned in front of a single sensor in the environment.


### VR Experiences
These icons are used to describe the difference between virtual reality based on 360° Imagery and real-time rendered 3d worlds.

 * `360° Imagery-based VR:` This is fx 360° photos, 360° Pre-rendered visualizations or 360° video. They allow user head rotation but restrict head movement and position (this is a bit like having a sphere stuck on your head).
 * `Real-time 3D-based VR:` Real-time rendered 3D worlds provide an unlimited virtual environment where users can freely move as they would in the real world (to the extend that the VR system allows them to).
 * `Seated Experience (with blinders):` A real-time rendered 3D world with which is experienced while sitting down and with partial rotational freedom.

### Movement in VR
Illustrations of different ways you can move in the virtual environment.

 * `Walking:` Either by doing so in the real world or simulated via input from a controller.
 * `Sliding:` Moving your position while remaining fixed to the ground.
 * `Flying:` Moving yourself in any direction of the virtual world.
 * `Teleporting:` Changing your absolute position from one coordinate to another.
 * `Driving a Virtual Vehicle:` Moving yourself by controlling a virtual vehicle.
 

### Misc
Various illustrations of different effects

 * `Parallax Effect:` Illustration of the parallax effect.
